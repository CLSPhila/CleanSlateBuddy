question: |
  Welcome to the Clean Slate Buddy (DEMO!) 
subquestion: |
  This is an experimental tool to help Pennsylvania Civil Legal Services 
  advocates draft expungement and sealing petitions. 
    
  Thanks to Clean Slate, many records are no longer visible to the public online.
  This protects Pennsylvanians' privacy and helps many around the state access 
  employment. But it also means that we can't automatically pull criminal records
  from a public website. So with tool, you can enter the criminal record information
  you wish to expunge or seal by hande.
  
  Its more manual than the Expungement Generator, but we hope its a helpful tool
  for drafting your petitions quickly.
  
  **This tool only fills in forms based on information you provide. Its up to you to do the legal analysis to figure out what petitions you can file**

  In which county are you filing petitions?
subquestion: |
  If you need to file petitions in multiple counties, you'll need to go through
  this site's interview for each county's petitions.
  
  If you frequently file in multiple counties and this is a big headache for you,
  please let Community Legal Services know, and we can try to figure out a different
  approach.
